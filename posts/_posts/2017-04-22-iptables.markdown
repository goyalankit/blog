I have been lately working with networks and have used **iptables** at several instances. During the process I dug into iptables a little bit and documenting my learnings here.

# Netfilter and IPTables

**Netfilter** provides a set of hooks inside Linux kernel networking stack which allows one to take action at different phases in routing process. 

`iptables` is a userland tool to interact with `netfilter` in kernel. `iptables` and `netfilter` together facilitate in enforcing different packet-filtering rules and setting up a basic firewall.
