I’m Ankit. I am a software engineer at LinkedIn. I like to mess around with new technologies. My interests are in distributed systems and operating systems. I like to create things.

I like to play soccer, listen to music, play Age of Empires; you know normal stuff. I watch way too much TV and like to read about new technologies. I am a coffee addict in search of a perfect coffee. So if you know of a good place for coffee, hit me up!

I like to learn languages. Puedo hablar Español, हिन्दी and ਪੰਜਾਬੀ . I’d like to learn French better and Mandarin Chinese.
