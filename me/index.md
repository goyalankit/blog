I’m Ankit. I like to mess around with new technologies. My interests are in distributed systems and operating systems. I aspire to create things.

I enjoy playing play soccer, listen to music, play Age of Empires; you know normal stuff. I watch way too much TV and like to read about new technologies. Once in a while I like a good cup of coffee; so if you know of a good place for coffee, hit me up!

I like to learn languages. Puedo hablar Español, हिन्दी and ਪੰਜਾਬੀ . I’d like to learn French better and Mandarin Chinese.

_Since you are here, enjoy the mesmerizing cat._
